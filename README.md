# Ecommerce

## Contribution
Created a e-commerce routes for a manager at an internet retail company .Who want back end for e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies
SO THAT company can compete with other e-commerce companies.

## Usage
-WHEN manager adds database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file then he is able to connect to a database using Sequelize
- WHEN he  enter schema and seed commands THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data
- WHEN he enter the command to invoke the application THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
WHEN he  open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN he test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core THEN he is able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database.
